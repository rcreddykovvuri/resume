    <p><strong>Project 1 (Dissertation): Disruptive technologies for smart farming: Tomato leaf disease recognition systems based on Machine learning</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reduced the size of the images to different dimensions and saved them using the pillow library andpython.</li>
        <li>Extracted the image data from various folders and converted it to vectors using python code.</li>
        <li>The overall vectors are saved to a NumPy file instead of a CSV file to save memory.</li>
        <li>Performed different machine learning and CNN models on tomato leaf image data. Compared different metrics of machine learning models with the CNN model.</li>
        <li>Finally, trained the best model with SVM due to its efficiency and saved the model as an SAV file using the pickle library.</li>
